Welcome to my personal blog. I open this blog when I am about to graduate from my university, at the time I extremely want to use something to document my life and things I've learned. And now I'm on my way to the United States to start a brand new experience of studying. I want to keep some memories through this blog, and meanwhile take some notes about the things that might be useful to my future development.

## About This Blog

Due to my major is computer science/engineering, so most of study notes are related to fields like computer science, computer engineering, software developing, etc., I have to admit that I'm not excel at such subjects, but I am still keen on them and wish to make something big from my own hands. Hope this blog can witness my improvements :)

This blog does not only focus on such academic matters. For other parts, I will upload some of my daily life records, like photos, music, and maybe some unexpected inspiration and ideas. And I will write each blog article in English as possible as I can, to improve my English writing skills, and maybe it's benefit to my future experience in the USðŸ™‚

**Hope you enjoy my blog, and discover something new!**
